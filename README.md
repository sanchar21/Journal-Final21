This example routing table can be read as:
‐ To send to all devices on the same network as me, i.e. local broadcast, send direct
(not to another router).
‐ To send to special multicast addresses starting 224, send direct
‐ To send to all devices on the network 10.162.35.0, i.e. directed broadcast, send direct.
‐ To send to the device 10.162.33.102, send direct.
‐ To send to anyone on the network 10.162.32.0, send direct.
‐ To send to anyone else in the Internet, send to 10.162.32.1.

Both the Ip Addresses are same as I am using same internet connection in both the divices.
ISP: Vodafone Australia Pty Limited
City: Parramatta (which is wrong)
Region: New South Wales
Country: Australia
### Task 4: 
IP Addresses, VPNs and Contract Cheating: 
Reasons for bypassing geolocation services with a VPN:
Access to restricted content: By using a VPN to appear in another country, students can access web services or content that may be geo-blocked in their current location. This allows them to overcome regional restrictions and access the content they desire.
Privacy and security: VPNs encrypt internet traffic, providing an additional layer of security and privacy. By bypassing geolocation services, students can protect their online activities from being tracked or monitored by government agencies, internet service providers, or other third parties.
Reasons against bypassing geolocation services with a VPN:
Legal and ethical concerns: Some web services and content providers enforce geolocation restrictions for licensing or legal reasons. Bypassing these restrictions may violate the terms of service and potentially infringe on copyright laws.
Academic integrity: If students use VPNs to access content or resources not intended for their current location, it can undermine the integrity of their education and the fairness of assessment processes. It may also violate university policies or codes of conduct.
Reasons for using IP addresses to identify possible contract cheating:
Geographic inconsistency: Contract cheating involves paying someone from another country to complete assessments. By comparing the IP address of an assessment submission to the student's expected location, universities can identify potential discrepancies and flag suspicious cases for further investigation.
Deterrence: The use of IP addresses as an indicator of potential contract cheating can act as a deterrent to students considering engaging in such behavior. The fear of detection may discourage them from seeking external assistance to complete their assessments.
Reasons against using IP addresses to identify possible contract cheating:
False positives: Relying solely on IP addresses to identify contract cheating can lead to false positives. Students may use legitimate VPNs for privacy or accessing content, resulting in their submissions being mistakenly flagged as contract cheating.
Technical limitations: IP addresses can be masked or spoofed, making it possible for students engaging in contract cheating to evade detection based on their IP location alone. Additionally, students may share their VPN accounts, further complicating the identification process.
Advice for future students regarding using a VPN while studying in Australia:
Familiarize yourself with university policies: Understand your university's policies and guidelines regarding the use of VPNs. Some institutions may have specific rules or restrictions in place.
Use VPNs responsibly: If you choose to use a VPN, ensure that you are aware of the legal and ethical implications. Respect geolocation restrictions imposed by web services and comply with university policies to maintain academic integrity.
Seek alternative solutions: Instead of relying solely on VPNs, explore legal and authorized methods of accessing content or resources from your home country. Universities often provide support services or alternatives to help students access necessary materials without resorting to circumvention methods.
It is important to note that the use of VPNs should comply with local laws and regulations, and users should exercise caution and responsibility when utilizing such services.

## Week 8: Attacks and Vulnerabilities:
### Task 1. CIA Protections The list of the important assets in the network are as follows: 
Asset 1: router 
Protection: confidentiality 
Reason: outsider should not be able to assess the information and change the setting on that router
Asset 2: computer
Protection: availability
Reason: if computer is down, saving of the network information and security information cannot be done as well as if the computer is used for saving different task such as recording video from camera it cannot be saved. 
Asset 3: Asses Point
Protection: confidentiality 
Reason: neighbour or any other people can assess the information of users in the network by connecting to the APs.
Asset 4: server 
Protection: integrity 
Reason:  if server is not using proper technology during saving, processing and transiting of date the user information will not be safe. 
Asset 5: video recorder
Protection: availability 
Reason: if video recorder is down the recording of video will be interrupted. 
### Task 2: The list of threat sources and motivation.
Threat source 1: hacker 
Motivation: Get information of the system to do different task such as getting the insider information and data so that they can send ads to the users of network.
Threats source 2: Natural disaster
Motivation: natural disaster such as lightning can caused damage to the hardware in our network.
Threats source 3: phishers 
Motivation: if someone are able to make camera down and want to steal it will be easier to them as the camera is not working and no information of thief is recorded.

### Task 4. Vulnerability Disclosures:
Vulnerability disclosure poses challenges in balancing transparency and security. Vendors may delay public disclosure to investigate and develop effective patches, addressing legal and reputational concerns. However, researchers face ethical dilemmas when vendors fail to disclose within a reasonable time. Responsible disclosure practices, emphasizing collaboration and timely patch deployment, are essential. Ultimately, the goal is to protect users while maintaining a healthy and secure ecosystem. Finding the right balance between transparency and security is key to successful vulnerability disclosure.

### Task 2:
 Here is an table including the  asset type:
 <img width="473" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sanchar21/Journal-Final21/assets/128453476/cac481b9-a702-4d06-b060-c592758fe65f">
In this table, the asset types include "Computer", "Access Point", "Server", "Video Recorder","Switch" and "CC camera". The "Data Asset Classification" column indicates whether each asset type involves data assets that need classification. Based on the table:
Computers and Servers typically contain data assets that need classification. They store and process various types of data.
Access Points and Switches do not typically involve data assets themselves. They are network infrastructure components that facilitate network connectivity.
Video Recorders, such as CCTV DVRs and NVRs CC Camera often store video footage, which constitutes a data asset that needs classification.
Remember that data asset classification involves identifying the sensitivity and criticality of data, allowing for appropriate security controls and protection measures.
### Task 3:
<img width="569" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sanchar21/Journal-Final21/assets/128453476/322c48e9-a733-4c64-81de-f2929e4e4910"> 
In this diagram, the "Computer" data asset is connected to the CC Camera, Server, Switch, and Access Point (AP). It indicates that the computer interacts with these assets, likely for data processing, management, and communication purposes.
<img width="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sanchar21/Journal-Final21/assets/128453476/32f9a20a-27ce-494a-8a6b-eeedf24646ac">
In this diagram, the "Server" data asset is connected to the Video Recorder (DVR or NVR), CC Camera, Switch, and Access Point (AP). This connection signifies the role of the server in managing and processing data from these assets, such as storing video footage from the CC cameras and providing network connectivity through the switch and access point.

## Week 10: 
### Task 1:  4 mitigation Strategies I select are:
Application Control: Implement whitelisting for authorized applications on all devices and ensure strict access controls for the network management application.
Patch Applications: Regularly update and patch operating systems, software, firmware, and security camera firmware to address vulnerabilities.
Restrict Administrative Privileges: Assign administrative privileges only to authorized individuals and limit user privileges to prevent unauthorized access.
Backup Data Regularly: Set up automated backups of critical data, including security camera footage, and verify backup integrity to ensure data availability and recovery.
Reasons for selecting these strategies: 
These strategies address key areas of concern in the security camera network , encompassing the protection of the network infrastructure, data, and systems used by the owner, rental agencies, and occupants.They directly align with the nature of the network, considering the mixed wired/wireless network, security camera management, and the need for secure access and data privacy for all stakeholders.By implementing these strategies, the network design can enhance its overall security posture, reduce the risk of cyber incidents, and ensure the privacy, availability, and integrity of critical data and systems.
### Task 3: I have selected six relevant base controls from different control families:
AC-2 (Account Management): Implement centralized user account management with strong password policies and regular review of user privileges.
AU-2 (Auditable Events): Configure systems to generate audit logs for critical events, such as logins and access attempts, and regularly review them for suspicious activities.
CM-6 (Configuration Settings): Establish baseline configurations for security cameras, network devices, and servers, and regularly update them to align with security guidelines.
IA-2 (Identification and Authentication): Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics or tokens, for network access.
MP-4 (Media Storage): Store recorded security camera footage on encrypted and secure storage devices, with access controls in place.
SI-7 (Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity): Apply regular patches and updates to devices, implement digital signatures, and integrity checks for software and firmware.
### Task 3: Encrypt a file:
<img width="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sanchar21/Journal-Final21/assets/128453476/77a54b8d-7a7d-43bd-a581-eb471539e2bd"> 
When sharing a secret key, it's important to prioritize security. One common approach is to use asymmetric encryption to securely transmit the key. However, limitations include potential vulnerabilities in the key exchange process and key management. To improve security, consider using symmetric key encryption, implementing secure key exchange protocols, utilizing secure communication channels, practicing secure key management, and implementing multi-factor authentication. These measures enhance the security of sharing secret keys and protect against unauthorized access.
### Task 4: <img width="375" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sanchar21/Journal-Final21/assets/128453476/9ec29a0d-5cc5-4d44-94f8-58899f4c7bde">
